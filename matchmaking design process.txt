When you land on the matchmaking page, it will ask you to fill a form if
you have a problem, and will match you with a person with a helper role.
The algorithm will go through the list of helper users, and pull aside those
who have similar interests and within a similar age group. Then choose
randomly within the group to be the match.

The design of the page would then be 

There will be 2 new columns on the table that displays their role and
whether or not they are matched at the moment, which will take them
out of the algorithm 

If there are no similar interests or age groups, the user will be matched
completely randomly

Create a notification center for helpers to know if they have been matched
